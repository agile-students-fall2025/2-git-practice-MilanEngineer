* [What is ‘Cerebral Valley’? San Francisco’s Nerdiest New Neighborhood](https://sfstandard.com/2023/01/13/what-is-cerebral-valley-san-franciscos-nerdiest-new-neighborhood/) – *The San Francisco Standard*

## What I Found Interesting
* **Full Circle:** This article describes a shift in the technology sector of San Francisco. People are revisiting its early 2000s roots where mainstream companies were first created in start up homes. With the tight knit and highly collaborative environments, many of these new start up homes are projected to be the new hubs of AI development.


* **Redefined Work Life Balance:** Workers are no longer restricted to their typical 9-5 hours. Instead, with these co-living spaces people are able to contribute to their projects around the clock. This blurs the line between work and life, but potentially accelerates the pace of innovation, which these people crave.


* **Migration Away From Cities:** Even though many traditional office buildings remain vacant, more engineers and founders are choosing to work out of residential spaces. These house based spaces create a more focused and community driven environment compared to traditional office spaces.

Despite its potential collaboration and efficiency benefits, I personally would not want to live with my co workers and see them constantly. I think that having a proper work life balance allows people to perform at their best.

* **Comments:**
It feels as though the original tech bubble that was silicon valley, that often was depicted as one monolithic bubble, has now divided itself into multiple smaller bubbles due to these hacker houses. *— Jessy*
